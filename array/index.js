const introduction = `
in javascript the array is special structure of data
we can stored data in objects and access them by key
but some times we need to store ordered data where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on .
for example we need a list of users or numbers
`

// DECLARATION
let arr1 = new Array(...[34,45,23,56]);
let arr2 = [34,23,12];


console.log(arr2[0]) // access to an index
//
/* arrays in js is deque :
    it works both as QUEUE + STACK
