    the Javascript runs in single thread . so it just can handle one task at a time .
    but the js engine can handle multiple tasks happening at same time.

    wait but how?
    
    answer : 
    
        there is a model named "Concurrency Model":
        in this model js engine can handle mutiple tasks at same time with "Event Loop".

        the Event Loop takes long running tasks , executes them in the background and puts
        them back in them main thread once they,re finished .
